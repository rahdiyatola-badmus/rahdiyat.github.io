# 👩🏽‍🔬 Rahdiyat Olaitan Ola-Badmus 
**First-class Microbiology Graduate | Aspiring Bioinformatician**  
📍 Lagos, Nigeria  
🎓 MSc Bioinformatics of Infectious Disease (Applicant) 

## 🧬 About Me
I am a passionate and curious graduate of Microbiology with a strong interest in using computational tools to understand microbial communities, infectious diseases, and antimicrobial resistance.
My academic journey has led me from the wet lab to the digital lab—where bioinformatics is transforming how we detect, track, and manage pathogens. I am currently pursuing postgraduate opportunities in **Bioinformatics of Infectious Disease and Pathogen Genomics**, with a special interest in **metagenomics, AMR gene prediction, and in silico analysis**.

## 🔬 Featured Project

### [🧪 Olusosun Landfill Metagenomics](https://github.com/rahdiyatola-badmus/Olusosun_Metagenomics_Project)
This project investigates the bacterial community structure and geochemistry of the Olusosun Landfill in Lagos, Nigeria. I extracted environmental DNA, performed 16S rRNA sequencing using PacBio technology, and analyzed microbial diversity in relation to heavy metals and pollutants.

**Key Skills Applied:**
- Environmental microbiology  
- 16S rRNA gene analysis  
- AMR profiling  
- Bioinformatics pipelines (Trimmomatic, PANDAseq, DUDE-Seq, EzBioCloud)

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: Trimmomatic, PANDAseq, UCLUST, DUDE-Seq, HMMER, EzBioCloud  
- **Molecular Biology**: DNA extraction, PCR, 16S rRNA sequencing  
- **Data Handling**: FASTA/FASTQ, CSV, Excel  
- **Programming**: Python (basic), R (learning), Linux shell (basic)  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub  
- **Scientific Writing**: Research reports, lab documentation

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Whole-genome assembly and annotation  
- AMR gene detection using CARD and ResFinder  
- Phylogenetic tree construction (MEGA, IQ-TREE)  
- Snakemake workflows and reproducible pipelines
